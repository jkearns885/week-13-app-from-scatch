# Create an App using Express and React from Scratch

Let's goooooo!

## Why

Watching videos, listening to instructors, reading tutorials online, and any actions that do not consist of you writing code will only get you so far. To be a successful programmer, you need lots of daily hands-on practice. Solving lots of code challenges.  Work on at least one personal project.

## How

You will review what you know and apply it to building your own app.

- Express for your API
- Mongo for your db:

URL is: mongodb+srv://jkearns885:Cpeyc1995@cluster0.schwj.mongodb.net/database1?retryWrites=true&w=majority

password is: Cpeyc1995



- React for your front-end

Use the slide decks and the previous repositories as your help to complete the coding steps.

Ask your group, any TAs, the instructor, etc for any help you need. We're in this together to all be full stack developers that can create any app we can dream of.

## All Together

Setup a personal mongodb in the cloud

## Instructions

### Step 1

Identify an app you want to build.

Ideas

- Your favorite hobby
- -> cooking, sewing, baking, running, shopping, skiing

- Your Job
- -> Tracking projects, issues, data, etc
- Put in one "goal" number input (i.e. 163) and then input a bunch of other numbers. Then, the app will output all the different combinations of the numbers that will equal exactly the goal number when they are added up.


- Charity
- Track charities or identify an app charities may need

- Anything! at all can be used for your app idea

## Step 2

NOTE: Commit to git early and often. Push to your personal repository often.

Create your PR early as early as you can.

Create an express api

Create http files to test your api

## Step 3

NOTE: Commit to git early and often. Push to your personal repository often, especially before each step.

Create a react UI

Create test files for your UI (more on this this week!)

## Step 4

NOTE: Commit to git early and often. Push to your personal repository often, especially before each step.

Deploy your app to the world (more on this this week!)
